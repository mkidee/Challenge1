# Challenge 1 Mckay Memmott

## Description

This challenge was completed in order to help us bootcamp students understand the importance of having a website that is accesible. Even more important, completing this
website challenge was to teach us what that looks like. If done correctly, then future projects created by those that have done this should be accesible for those
who use screen readers and other tools to help them view our websites.

## Installation

## Usage

When you check the html, you should see semantic elements, divs with descriptions, well written alt texts, a correct structure of html elements, and a descriptive title
for our website. This example project is a good example of what an accesible site should look like.
